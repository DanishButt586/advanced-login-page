# Animated Multi‚ÄëTheme Glass Login UI

<em>Polished. Adaptive. Accessible. Playful.</em>

**Author:** Danish Butt  ‚Ä¢  **Stack:** HTML ¬∑ CSS ¬∑ JavaScript (no frameworks)

</div>

> An eye‚Äëcatching login experience featuring glassmorphism, soft lighting, animated line backdrop, multi‚Äëtheme switching, adaptive performance fallback, and a mischievous evasive login button that refuses weak input.

## ‚ú® Highlights
| Category | What You Get |
|----------|--------------|
| Visual Style | Glass layers, halo glow, subtle depth + parallax tilt |
| Theming | 4 instant themes (Default, Midnight, Aurora, Sunset) via CSS variables |
| Motion | Animated lines canvas + breathable orb ambience (auto-throttled) |
| Playfulness | Evasive (runaway) login button until both fields are filled |
| Performance | FPS probe removes heavier effects on low-end devices |
| Accessibility | Visible labels, focus rings, aria-live errors, strong contrast |
| UX Details | Floating labels, password toggle, responsive layout |
| Simplicity | Pure HTML/CSS/JS ‚Äì easy to drop into any project |

## üñº Preview (Add Screenshots)
Create a `screenshots/` folder and drop e.g.:
```
screenshots/
	default-theme.png
	midnight-theme.png
	aurora-theme.png
	sunset-theme.png
```
Then embed:
`![](screenshots/default-theme.png)`

## üé® Theme System
Themes are defined with `[data-theme="..."]` blocks setting CSS custom properties:
```
--accent, --accent-alt, --accent-hover, --accent-glow, --accent-link
```
Add a new theme by cloning one block in `style.css` and adjusting values.

## üß† Adaptive Performance Logic
An initial ~0.8s frame sample estimates FPS. If below the threshold, the script applies `low-perf` and removes heavier decorative layers (e.g. beam effects) while retaining core interactivity & clarity.

## ‚ôø Accessibility Commitments
- Semantic labels (no placeholder-only anti-pattern)
- `aria-live` region for dynamic messages (hidden until needed)
- High-contrast focus outlines preserved
- Motion stops (button returns) once input is valid
- Legible sizing & weight upgrades for readability

## üß™ Folder Structure
```
login.html   # Markup + theme switcher + structure
style.css    # Variables, themes, visual depth, animations, responsive rules
script.js    # Theme logic, performance guard, evasive button + background lines
README.md    # Project documentation
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
Open the page directly:
```powershell
Set-Location "D:\Experiement on Web\Login Page"
Start-Process .\login.html
```
Or just double‚Äëclick `login.html` in your file explorer.

## üîß Common Customizations
| Goal | File | Tip |
|------|------|-----|
| Add a theme | style.css | Duplicate a theme block & tweak `--accent*` vars |
| Reduce motion | script.css + style.css | Add a `[data-reduced]` flag & gate animations |
| Change evasive logic | script.js | Edit `moveButtonRandom()` & proximity radius |
| Success message style | style.css | Add `.message.success { border-color:... }` |
| Turn off roaming | script.js | Bypass calls to `moveButtonRandom()` when empty |

## üõ§ Roadmap Ideas
- Success / warning message variants
- Reduced‚Äëmotion user toggle
- Optional WebGL background mode
- Light mode variant with dynamic contrast
- Credential validation integration / API hook

## üß© Architecture at a Glance
| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| HTML | Structure, accessibility hooks, theme buttons |
| CSS | Themes (custom properties), visual depth, animations, layout |
| JS | Theme activation, performance probe, evasive button logic, canvas lines |

## üß™ Performance Notes
- Short frame sampling instead of heavy continuous monitoring
- Canvas resolution capped by DPR strategy
- Expensive layers removed under `low-perf`
- Minimal reflows: transforms used for motion

## ÔøΩ Security Notice
This is a UI demo only. No real authentication logic or hashing is implemented. Integrate with your backend before production use.
